When adding or editing media, you will have to following options:

### Title / Alternative Text

This can be used to describe the image or to assign a specific purpose to it.

### Replace file

This feature only is available when editing an existing media. It allows you to replace the file in the Media Library without needing to manually update it in each piece of content where itâ€™s used. Simply upload the new file, and it will automatically replace the old one wherever it has been embedded.
