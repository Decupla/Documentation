# Users & Roles

Decupla allows you to create as many different users as you want. The rights a user has in the system are determined by the user's role.

## Users

When creating or editing a user, you have the following options:


| Option  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Name | The name of the user. This could be the full name of the user, the first name or just a nickname. |
| E-Mail | This is the e-mail address the user will use to log in to Decupla. This e-mail address has to be **unique**. |
| Password | The password the user will use to lig into Decupla. The password has to be a **minimum length of 8 characters** and a **maximum length of 30 characters**. To make the password as secure as possible, it is recommended to use a combination of **upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters**. |
| Role | The user's role determines what permissions the user has in the system. For more information about roles, see the next section. |

## Roles

Since you know best which roles you need for your project, we don't give you any predetermined roles. Depending on your requirements, you can create roles with the necessary permissions yourself.

The only role that is always present and **cannot be edited** is the "**Adminstrator**" role. This role has **all rights** and is assigned by default to the first user of the system. Of course, this role can also be assigned to other users.

When creating a role, you can choose **which rights should be assigned to the role**. The following rights are available:

| Right | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Manage Content | This right allows the user to **create new content** as well as **edit and delete existing content**. |
| Manage Menus | This right allows the user to **create new menus** as well as **edit and delete existing menus**. |
| Manage Blocks | This right allows the user to **create new blocks** as well as **edit and delete existing blocks**. |
| Manage Users | This right allows the user to **add new users** to the system as well as **edit and delete existing users**. |
| Manage Roles | This right allows the user to **create new roles** as wall as **edit and deleting existing roles**. |
| Mange Settings | This right allows the user to **change Decupla's settings**. This includes **changing the start content** as well as **creating, editing and deleting API keys**. |
