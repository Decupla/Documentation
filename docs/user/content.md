# Content

The content is the most important part of decupla. You can think of it as a page of a website or a mobile app. This section will explain everything you need to know to create and edit content.

## Options

Below, we will explore all the available options when creating or editing content.

| Option  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Title | The title of the content. Depending on your project, it can serve as the title of a webpage, the SEO title, or be used for other purposes. |
| Description | A short description of your content. For example, it can be used for SEO purposes or to provide a preview in a post archive. |
| URL | The URL where the content can be accessed within your application. If you don't set a URL by yourself, a url will be auto-generated. |
| Status |Â You can choose whether the content should be saved as **published** or as a **draft**. If saved as a draft, it will not be included when retrieving all content from the [API](/docs/developer/api/content). |

## Blocks

In Decupla, each content is assembled from the instances of different blocks. For example, you can add text-block to your content and a author-block which provides some information about the author. You can learn more about blocks [here](/docs/user/blocks).
