# Menus

To simplify navigation in websites or applications integrated with Decupla, the created content can be organized into menus.

## Key

In addition to the title of the menu, there is a field called 'key'. This key helps the developer of your website or application to integrate this menu more easily as the **menu can be retrieved through the API using the key**. This key must be **unique**.

## Entries

The existing **content** from Decupla can be **added as entries** in the menu. Within the menu, the entries can be sorted using the navigation arrows.
When creating the menu, **only published content appears** for selection. Please note that if a content item that is already included in the menu is later **changed to "Draft"**, the entry **will still remain visible**.
