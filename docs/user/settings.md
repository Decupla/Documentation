## API-Keys
In order to protect the API from unwanted access, an API-Key must be transmitted when the API is called. In the settings you can create as many different API-Keys as you want. It is recommended to create a separate API key for each origin that calls the API.

When creating a key, a name can be specified in addition to the actual key. This name is irrelevant to the actual authentication and is only used to assign a purpose or origin to the key.

The key itself is a string consisting of **32 random letters and numbers**. To save you the trouble of creating these strings manually, you can have them **generated automatically**.
